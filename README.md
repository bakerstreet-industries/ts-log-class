`logger-decorator` is a helper utility that will add log output for all methods of a class by adding a `@log` decorator to the class definition. Stop adding console.log or other logging strategies within each method, but have it done for you. I wrote this utility specifically so that I could continue writing tests for the [aws-ts-starter](https://github.com/bakerstreet-industries/aws-ts-starter).
